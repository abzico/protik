# protik

Protik is a chrome extention program that helps protect your flow of productivity from other Twitter users' views via tweets on Twitter feed.

It only works at main page of twitter at [https://twitter.com](https://twitter.com) as it's the main entry or the door to rabbit hole linking to others. This will reduce much of tendency to click on any distracting tweets. Stay focused!

# Features

* Automatically remove tweet cards from all twitter users that are not in the exception list
* Automatically expand new tweet and immediately does its job normally to filter tweets for you
* User can configure exception list to allow tweets for some users to be shown
* It works for multiple chrome tabs you might have, they all take effect the same
* You can just wait until there are more tweets, or scroll to the bottom normally. protik will apply filtering work for you automatically for both case.
